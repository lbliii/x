.. Analysis
.. ==========

.. Observations

.. 1. The code needed for autodocs mostly lives in ``/harness/determined``.

.. - Autodoc 
.. - Crosslinking

.. Cons 
.. ----

.. 2. Current preview / deploy process is complicated


.. Migration Challenges
.. ----
.. 1. There isn't a direct replacement for **crosslinking** or **autodocs**.
